If you’ve seen **The Big Bang Theory**, you’ve heard of a game called **“Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock”**.
The TV show popularised Sam Kass and Karen Bryla’s expanded version of **“Rock, Paper, Scissors”**, which included two more hand gestures, **“Lizard”** and **“Spock”**.
Kass and Bryla’s original invention was titled **“Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, Lizard”**, which is more logically correct, but the game is more commonly known as **“Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock”**.

I’ll let **Sheldon Cooper** explain the rules of the game to you.

- Scissors cuts Paper
- Paper covers Rock
- Rock crushes Lizard
- Lizard poisons Spock
- Spock smashes Scissors
- Scissors decapitates Lizard
- Lizard eats Paper
- Paper disproves Spock
- Spock vaporizes Rock
- And, as it always has, Rock crushes Scissors
